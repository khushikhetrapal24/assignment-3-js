# Assignment 3

This JavaScript web app displays various daily menus which can be viewed by clicking either the next or previous buttons.  

To create this "Bun on the Run" menu app the following JavaScript concepts were used

1. First I defined a const called menus and assigned it to be an empty array
   - js const menus = []
   - The reason why I did that is because the menus array will eventually be assigned an array of objects where each object represents a daily menu, complete with menu items and prices.

2. Next I defined a variable called page and initialised it's value as 0
   - js let page = 0;
   - The reason why I did that is because it's value is eventually going to change.
   - If i would have defined it as const then i would not be able to change the value of page.
    
3. Next I defined a const called menuTitle,nextBtn,soupName,saladName,lighterFare,entree,soupPrice,saladPrice,lighterFarePrice,entreePrice,prevBtn and targeted it using document.querySelector
   - js const menuTitle = document.querySelector('#menutitle');
   - const nextBtn = document.querySelector('#nextMenu');
   - const soupName = document.querySelector('#soupName');
   - const saladName = document.querySelector('#saladName');
   - const lighterFare = document.querySelector('#lighterFareName');
   - const entree = document.querySelector('#entreeName');
   - const soupPrice = document.querySelector('#soupPrice');
   - const saladPrice = document.querySelector('#saladPrice');
   - const lighterFarePrice = document.querySelector('#lighterFarePrice');
   - const entreePrice = document.querySelector('#entreePrice');
   - const prevBtn = document.querySelector('#previousMenu');  

4. The reason why I did that because i had to change the menu title . Next I defined a function called display which take in a parameter called menu1 js       function display(menus1){
   - menuTitle.textContent = menus[page].title;
   - soupName.textContent = menus[page].soup;
   - saladName.textContent = menus[page].salad;
   - lighterFareName.textContent = menus[page].lighterFare;
   - entreeName.textContent = menus[page].entree;
   - soupPrice.textContent = menus[page].soupPrice;
   - saladPrice.textContent = menus[page].saladPrice;
   -lighterFarePrice.textContent = menus[page].lighterFarePrice;
   - entreePrice.textContent = menus[page].entreePrice;
   }
5. This function displays the current menu.  For exammple, it displays the menu title by using the value of page variable.. Next I defined a function called jsonf which will fetch our menus data in JSON format
   - js
   - async function getMenus() {
   - const jsonf = await fetch(
      "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/khushikhetrapal24/04d9f46b03031839b96aa81022a826cd/raw/ab68e6b82433e4e924de63f728b1ceba850bad53/menu.json");
   - const data = await jsonf.json();
   - menus.push(...data);
   - display();}
   - First I defined a constant called jsonf which will be assigned the the link to our json data.
   - Next I defined a const called data which is assigned the json data
   - Next I inserted that entire array of objects into our menus array by using spread operator  
   - Next I called the function display to display our current menu passing in the argument of our first menu in our array
6. Next I defined a function called previous which takes no parameter but decrements our currentIndex by 1 then calls our display function  js
   - function previous()
      {
        if (page === 0){
          page = 4;
        }
        else {
          page = page - 1;  
        }
        display();
      }
    
    The reason I'm manipulating the value of page is that it will prevent the previous function from going out of bounds.

7. In similar fashion, I also created a function called next with similar logic.
   - js
   - function next()
      {
        if (page === menus.length-1){
          page = 0;
        }
        else {
          page = page + 1;  
        }
        display();
      }

8. Next I added some click event listeners to both next and previous buttons
   - js
    nextBtn.addEventListener("click",next);
    prevBtn.addEventListener("click",previous);
    
    The reason for adding click event handlers is so that we can move to next menu as well as previous menu.
